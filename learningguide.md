# Learn Programming

We Live in an **Information Age**, Every aspect of our life is being impacted by computing in one way or another.  

So what time is better than this to learn about Ins and out's of computing?  
In this Repository, I Created a Great Guide to Programming, for absolute beginners who don't have any knowledge about computing and programming.  

But I can only show you(New Programmer) the way to Programming. You have to walk the path yourself.  
Being a programmer or Developer is in general a task that needs Creativity, Patience, Problem Solving Skills(What doesn't?).  

If done right, Development can be an amazing field.  
So without further ado,**Let's Begin!**

## Languages

In this repo, I am trying to provide a guide for multiple programming languages, with useful exercises and solutions to them.  
My end goal is for anyone reading this is to use them in real-time applications or land a job using this guide.  

The Programming Languages I am including are  

1. [C](./files/Languages/C.md)
2. [C++](./files/Languages/C++.md)
3. [C#](./files/Languages/Csharp.md)
4. [Java](./files/Languages/Java.md)
5. [Kotlin](./files/Languages/Kotlin.md)
6. [JavaScript](./files/Languages/JavaScript.md)
7. [Python](./files/Languages/Python.md)

All these Programming Languages are quite similar and different at the same time.  

At the beginning stage of learning any programming language, up to  30% of concepts are similar between all other languages, after that, the core language concepts start which differ from each other.  

Each language supports the same concept in different ways.  

Read [Programming Paradigm document](./files/Paradigms/ProgrammingParadigms.md) for more In-Depth information about all these languages.  
Trust me it helps a lot to read it first before learning any particular language.  

In this Guide, I explained each individual concept in their respective section, then linked their actual implementation in each programming language.

I think this way we can learn the concepts at a high level, then use these concepts in various languages with ease.  

Each Concept is the base that is used to build further concepts, so it's very important to understand each concept as best as you can.

I did my best in making this guide, hope you like it.  

## Path to Follow  

Here is the best path to learning any programming language(My own opinion).  

1. **Pick one language** and stick with it.
   1. If you already have a little knowledge of any above-mentioned languages it is better to start with it. This will speed up your learning curve.
   2. My suggestion is to start with either **Python** or **Java**. Since these languages are the most used and popular in Software Industry, they have a big community of developers that can back you up on how to resolve the issues/bugs you face during your learning period.  

2. **Solve** all **Problems** given in [Exercises](./files/Exercises/Exercises.md) file.
   1. First understand the given problem and try to solve it with the concepts you have learned so far.  
   2. Try your own logic first before seeing the [Solution](./files/Exercises/Solutions.md) for it or searching StackOverflow for it.  
   3. This is Critical, which helps you think like a coder and problem solver.  
   4. Over time as you learn new concepts enhance your code accordingly.

3. **Refer** to the official **documentation** of each respective language.
   1. Each above-mentioned programming language is **Open-Source**, so all of them provide good documentation for each module/feature they have.
   2. **Learn HOW** the **documentation** is written, this will put you on a path of better documenting your own code(Which is often neglected but is Critical for others to understand your code).

4. After learning a programming language completely. Try to **Build a Basic [Project](./files/Exercises/Projects.md)** using that language.
   1. Google "Simple projects to build with basic `your Programming Language`", to find some good projects and build one which you like. This will teach you how to actually put use the concepts you learn to a **real product**.
   2. **Re-Search** which **path** you want **to take**, All the above languages are popular in the Software Industry, but not all are the same(duh!!).
   3. Each Language has its own usage and need.
      * C is great for the low-level, kernel, driver/O.S development.  
      * C++ is great for applications that need high Performance, like IoT applications, packages for another language, and games.  
      * C# and Java are great for the Back-End of the Web, Mobile, Desktop applications.  
      * Kotlin is best for Android Development.
      * JavaScript is great for the Back-End and Front-End of the Web, Mobile, Desktop Applications.
      * Python is great for Machine-Learning, Data-Science, Server Back-End, Scripting.
